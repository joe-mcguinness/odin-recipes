    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Hearty, filling, and versatile, chili is a staple comfort food for very good reason. !</p>
    <h2>Ingrediants</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Onion</li>
        <li>Garlic</li>
        <li>Minced beef</li>
        <li>Spices</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>After chopping your onion and garlic, you’re ready to start on your chili journey. Add your onion first to a
            large pot, then cook until soft and translucent before adding your garlic. Then, it’s time to add your
            tomato paste. Now, this step is one that you don’t want to rush, especially if you love a strong tomato
            flavor in your chili. Spend the time (at least 2 to 3 minutes) to really cook it down—wait until it takes on
            a dark color and begins to stick to the pot.</li>
        <li>Once your tomato paste has cooked down, you're ready to add your beef, and stir to combine.
        </li>
        <li>Once your ground beef is added, it’s time to add in the flavor powerhouse: the 4 key spices. If you’re not a
            fan of spice, feel free to adjust or omit the cayenne! </li>
        <li>Once your spices are added, it’s time to bulk the chili up with our crushed tomatoes and beans. I know, I
            know—beans are highly debatable in chili, but they're a must-have for me.
        </li>
    </ol>
