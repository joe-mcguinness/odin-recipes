    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Dark and sticky caramel, sweet apples and crisp pastry combine to make this heavenly French dessert.</p>
    <h2>Ingrediants</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Pastry</li>
        <li>Dessert apples</li>
        <li>Butter</li>
        <li>Sugar</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Roll the pastry to a 3mm-thick round on a lightly floured surface and cut a 24cm circle, using a plate as a
            guide. Lightly prick all over with a fork, place on a baking sheet, then cover and freeze while preparing
            the apples.
            1</li>
        <li>Heat oven to 180C/160C fan/gas 4. Peel, quarter and core the apples. Put the sugar in a flameproof 20cm
            ceramic tatin dish or a 20cm ovenproof heavy-based frying pan and place over a medium-high heat. Cook the
            sugar for 5-7 mins to a dark amber caramel syrup that’s starting to smoke, then turn off the heat and stir
            in the 60g diced chilled butter.</li>
        <li>To assemble the tarte tatin, arrange the apple quarters very tightly in a circle around the edge of the dish
            first, rounded-side down, then fill in the middle in a similar fashion. Gently press with your hands to
            ensure there are no gaps. Brush the fruit with the melted butter.
        </li>
        <li>Bake in the oven for 30 mins, then remove and place the disc of frozen puff pastry on top – it will quickly
            defrost. Tuck the edges down the inside of the dish and, with a knife, prick a few holes in the pastry to
            allow steam to escape. Bake for a further 40-45 mins until the pastry is golden brown and crisp.
        </li>
    </ol>
